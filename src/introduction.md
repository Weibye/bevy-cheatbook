# Unofficial Bevy Cheat Book

Concise practical reference to the
[Bevy game engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy).

Covers useful syntax, features, programming patterns, and solutions for
common game development tasks.

Designed to be easy to read, straight to the point, using simple language
to focus on the important information.

While rich in content, this book does not aim to be exhaustive or complete. It
cannot feasibly cover every feature of bevy. It is my best attempt to teach
the most practically-relevant aspects.

The book has several sections:

  - [Bevy Cheatsheet](./cheatsheet.md):
    condensed one-page listing of common Bevy syntax and features
  - [Bevy Programming](./programming/_index.md):
    overview of programming in Bevy
  - [Bevy Features](./features/_index.md):
    how to use various Bevy features
  - [Common Pitfalls](./pitfalls/_index.md):
    common issues or surprises to watch out for
  - [Advanced Patterns](./patterns/_index.md):
    non-obvious tricks or techniques; may be controversial
  - [Bevy Cookbook](./cookbook/_index.md):
    examples covering common practical use cases

Not intended to be read in order. Jump to whatever is useful to you!

## Stability Warning

Bevy is still a very new and experimental game engine! It has only been
public since August 2020!

While improvements have been happening at an incredible pace, and development
is active, Bevy simply hasn't yet had the time to mature.

*There are no stability guarantees and breaking changes happen often!*

Usually, it not hard to adapt to changes with new releases (or even track
the main git development branch), but you have been warned!
